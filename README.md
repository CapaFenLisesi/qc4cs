A repo containing porgramming exercise from the book [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientist](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky-ebook/dp/B00AHTN5NS)

I had immense pleasure learning Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Information theory from there. The material is not actually that difficult to understand.

With a good idea of high school math and an introductory understanging of Linear Algebra you can access a good lot of QM.

These exercises are done mainly to make sure that I understood the material properly. Also the originl book uses Matlab. But I know Python :)
